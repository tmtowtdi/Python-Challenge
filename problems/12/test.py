"""
Page contains "evil1.jpg".

Since it's numbered, try "evil2.jpg", which is an image whose text suggests we 
try "evil2.gfx".

evil2.gfx can't be displayed in the browser - downloaded.

evil3.jpg says "no more evils"

evil4.jpg exists, but isn't a jpg.  It's a text file containing
    Bert is evil! go back!

http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/bert.html
    caption: "Yes! Bert is evil!"
    image: Bert the muppet looking evil and possibly raping another muppet.
    I think this is teh funnay and not part of the puzzle. 

At this point, a solution site tells me the "bert is evil" think is a clue for 
problem 13, and this problem appears to be more nonsense involving interleaved 
graphics files.

I'm tired of fucking with graphics files; I'm learning more about graphics 
file formats than I am about Python, and the fact that the bert clue in this 
puzzle is a hint for the next puzzle means that the whole thing is trying way 
too hard to be mysterious and hard-to-solve for non-python reasons.  

I think I'm done with this now.  Back to the much more reasonable Euler 
project.
